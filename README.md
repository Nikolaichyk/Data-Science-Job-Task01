# Airbus Ship Detection Challenge
This project aims to tackle the Airbus Ship Detection Challenge, a computer vision task focused on semantic segmentation. The goal is to build a model that can accurately detect and segment ships in satellite images.  
## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/data). It consists of a large collection of satellite images along with corresponding pixel-wise labels indicating ship locations.
